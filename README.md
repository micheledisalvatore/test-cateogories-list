# Notes
Check the preview of this project on [netlify](https://boring-bohr-de5933.netlify.com/)
Written different user case tests for Item component.
Not accomplished the last user journey due to the fact that it is not part of the requirements.


# Task
This coding test is designed to show us your thought process and approach, as well as demonstrate your skills.
We feel that, using the right technologies, it is possible to achieve what the test asks for in 2-3 hours. You may spend more time on the test if you wish.
Feel free to ask us questions if you need to.

## Technologies
The only requirement is that you use Typescript. You can use whatever frameworks and libraries
you feel are best, or are most comfortable with. Points will not be won or lost based on this
choice, providing it is fit for purpose.
Please choose an appropriate CSS framework or implement something yourself so that what we
review is pleasant to look at and shows some thought as to layout and interactivity.

## Requirements
Create an application which will allow a user to manage categories of items. The categories
should be in a hierarchy of potentially infinite depth. The items only require a label.
The user should be able add, edit and remove both categories and items.
Your solution should follow best practice. We expect to see the same techniques and
approaches that you would use in a real project.

## User journey
Tom wants to keep track of his belongings. He is presented with a list of categories, showing the
different levels visually.
- He adds the category "Electronics", and under that, "Televisions".
- To this category he adds the items "49-inch LCD", "40-inch plasma", and "32-inch CRT".
- He adds the category "Gaming consoles", and under this, the items "PS4", "XBox One".
- He edits "Gaming consoles" to sit under "Electronics".

## Bonus points
The following areas are not required, but if you choose to include them we will count them as
bonus points.
● Validation
● Sensible and appropriate tests
● Animations

# React APP

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
